## Go files:

There are three different files with functions and one with tests for different cases.

<ol>
<li>Function to sort words with repeated characters</li>

<li>Function that takes one parameter as an array or list</li>
</ol>

<div>Result: <span><img src="twogoimage.png" alt="two.go solution" > </span> </div>

#### three.go

Type: `go run three.go` and the program will run and pick the data from the array

<div>Result: <span><img src="threegoimage.png" alt="three.go solution" > </span> </div>
